# Notes 
In the course of the experiment , the 75mm lens was replaced by a 100mm lens so that the beam is not clipped by the wedges. As a result the 100mm lens in front of the FPI was no longer necessary and therefore removed. 

# Experiment: 
Parameter: 
- power level = 45%, 
- single longitudinal mode

Measurements: 

| $Z/mm$ | $2W_{off}$ | $\Delta(2W_{off})/\mu n$ |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0 | 1200 | 20 |
| 20.3 | 1045| 15|
| 50.1 | 800| 15 |
| 76.4 | 170 | 10 |
| 102.1 | 150 | 5 |
| 114.9 |  | 5 |

Notes:  $\Delta Z = 2mm$ -> Analysis using hyperbolic fill yields $\mu^{2}=1.0(0)$
